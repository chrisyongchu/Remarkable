## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/chrisyongchu/Remarkable/issues) is the preferred method for reporting bugs, feature requests and submitting pull requests. Please respect the following restrictions:

* **Be nice**. We're all part of the same community, so be friendly, be welcoming, and generally be a nice person. We reserve the right to delete comments which violate this rule.
* Please **do not** use the issue tracker for support requests.
* Please **do not** troll issues. 

## Reporting bugs

A bug is a consistent _replicable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful!

Guidelines for reporting bugs:

1. **Validate your code** to ensure that your problem isn't caused by an error in your own code.
2. **Use the GitHub issue search** to check if the issue has already been reported by someone.
3. **Check if the issue has already been fixed**.

We shouldn't need to ask you for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. Include information such as:

* Your environment
* Steps taken to replicate the issue
* Does it only occur in a specific browser or OS?

Details like the above can help us fix any potential bugs.
